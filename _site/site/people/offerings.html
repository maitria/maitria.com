      <h1>Agile coaching</h1>
        <p>A thriving agile team speaks up, asks questions, reflects and
        learns from mistakes. They learn the technical chops to share a
        codebase, respond to change, and deliver frequently. They dig in to
        really understand what's required, and collaborate to create something
        the customers and stakeholders will love.</p>

      <h1>Retrospective facilitation</h1>
        <p>Retrospectives can be the key to agile improvement. Or
        they can be yet another boring, useless meeting that takes away from
        coding time. Which are yours?</p>
        <p>Imagine a retro that uncovers hidden or deep-rooted issues, inspires the team
        to take ownership of their process, and encourages action to improve things.</p>

      <h1>Retrospective facilitator workshop</h1>
        <p>Good retrospectives are vital to agile's learning and adaptation
        culture. And facilitators with strong skills make for good retros.</p>
        <p>A group of skilled facilitators in your organization can provide
        neutral facilitation for each other's teams. As a <a
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice">community of
        practice</a>, they can learn together and give each other support for the
        challenges any good facilitator will face.</p>

      <h1>Pair programming workshop</h1>
        <p>"I didn't become a programmer because of my social skills."</p>
        <p>Agile nerds need to collaborate. To enable a shared codebase, we
        learn to write clean, well-crafted object-oriented code, and we often
        do it in pairs.</p>
        <p>But pair programming is harder than it sounds. We need skills
        to make it possible. We are technical and
        we are human. Let's get better at being both.</p>
