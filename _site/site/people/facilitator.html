 <h2>Facilitator</h2>
 <p class = "when">1984 - present</p>
 <p>As a facilitator of retrospectives and other meetings, I encourage
 real collaboration. When I facilitate, each person learns to identify
 what's most important to them, everybody gets heard, and new ideas
 emerge that none of us could have come up with on our own. And meetings
 end on time.</p>
