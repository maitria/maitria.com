#JoyConf Code of Welcoming Conduct
We are coming together with an intent to care for ourselves and one another. We want to nurture an empathetic conference culture. What we mean by "code of conduct" is that this is the container we want to create. This is the structure for our gathering, the foundation. This document is a piece of the culture we're creating.

##Is this really necessary? 
Sometimes things go wrong. This code of conduct is an effort to prevent people being hurt, and to talk about what might happen if someone is hurt.
###Specific things
Here are some specific things that have occurred at conferences. We do not expect them to occur at JoyConf (of course!). We also want to take positive action to prevent them. Just to be sure.

- Someone talked about vim as though non-vim people are less-than, and onlookers felt shitty.
- A woman was followed back to the hotel by drunk men she doesn't know, loudly joking about how hot she is.
- A black man attending a conference overheard white folks "acting black"
- A drunk boss groped a female employee, with other people looking on.

##The first rule of JoyConf is consent
No one at JoyConf, or at any events associated with JoyConf, may speak to, touch, stare at, follow, or otherwise engage someone without their consent. Making jokes within earshot of someone you know (or even think) is upset by them is a violation of consent. Acting as though someone's gender is other than what they say it is is also a violation of consent. Doing things that people feel shitty about is often a violation of consent. Doing them more than once is even more likely a violation of consent.

###But if I have to have consent, how do I ever start a conversation?
Some folks have asked this, so here's some clarification.

We make guesses or assessments of consent (willingness, welcome, invitation) all the time. Then we stay open to signs that the consent isn't there. A friendly smile might indicate consent to start a conversation. It might not. We learn that in the interaction. We are open to making mistakes, and learning from them. Sometimes we ask directly. The more we learn to be empathetic and see other people, the more we're able to talk about consent.

For example, many of us have started asking. "Are you a hugger?" instead of assuming it's okay. On the other hand, if I don't see any signs to the contrary, I'll assume it's okay with someone at a conference if I say "Hi" or "Excuse me, would you like to..."

###Consenting
If you don't want to, for example, be in a conversation, maybe you can say so, or maybe it's hard. Maybe you give some other indication that you don't want to engage. On the one hand, if it's hard to say so, maybe JoyConf would be a place to practice saying what's real for you. Saying "no thanks", etc. On the other hand, if your indications aren't being heard, and this isn't a time when you're interested in being more direct, you can also ask for help from other folks. "They aren't taking the hint. Will you help?" 

##The other first rule of JoyConf is no shaming

Shaming is hard to define. So we don't define it, we listen to each other. We work to learn how our behavior affects others. Here are some areas you may get the opportunity to learn about.

- No racism
- No geekier-than-thou
- No sexism
- No harassing people nursing babies
- No ableism
- No being mean to kids
- No homophobia
- No fatphobia or body shaming
- No (pro- or anti-) religious shaming 

##When someone's hurting
When someone's hurting, there is a problem. There is no such thing as "overreacting". There is hurting, and there is empathy.

##Empathy is our preference
When something's happened and someone is hurting, our first choice is to work through it. If an attendee's actions result in someone feeling unsafe, the staff will take the situation seriously. 

##But empathy isn't the only option
Sometimes, one or both parties are either uninterested or unable to work through the problem. Sometimes, to do so might take more time that we have. To not understand why something is hurtful is okay, as long as you approach it with care and curiosity. Repeating hurtful behavior is not allowed, and that will result in removal from the conference.

If, in the view of the staff, someone is not able to follow the conference rules, that person may be ejected from the conference without refund or compensation

##What to do if you experience something you aren't okay with
- You have the option of trying to speak with the person who is giving you trouble. 
- If you want to, you may ask for staff support for this conversation.
- If you don't want to, or if they refuse to speak to you, you can get an organizer to help you. Your pre-conference email will contain complete contact information for staff.

##Contributing to a culture of empathy
If someone "calls you out", hear the feedback. Listen for their experience, the feelings coming up. Consider how those emotions feel to you; notice what you have in common. Accept that something you did brought those feeling up for that person. Doesn't mean you decide you are bad, or you were "wrong" -- it means that you notice what happened, and accept it. Receive the feedback, and whatever clarifications they're _happy_ to provide, and then in private, mull them over. Ask friends questions, and decide for yourself what resonates with you and what doesn't, and what actions you want to take in response.

If you see something that seems off or scary, ask how folks are doing, or grab a staff member for help. We will not blow you off. We will be grateful.

##Addendum for staff & volunteers
As staff or volunteer, you have a lot of jobs. Here are several:

- It is your job to be available to solve problems that come up relating to people, like if someone's not able to follow the code of conduct. 
- It's also your job to solve accessibility issues, like if there's a cord that could trip someone using a cane, or if aisles aren't big enough for a wheelchair, or any other access issue.
- It's your job to make sure transgender folk have access to bathrooms.
- It's your job to watch for people feeling left out, and include them.
