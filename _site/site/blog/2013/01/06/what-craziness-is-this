        <p>You may be wondering what&rsquo;s going on here.</p>
        <p>One day, we were talking about the world of IT, enterprise software,
        frameworks from hell, and feeling a little down. Then we decided to put
        some thought to what we really love about this work, and why we&rsquo;re
        here.</p>
        <p>Lots of long walks and conversations and lattes later, we came up with
        what you see on the front page, and the name Maitria.</p>
        <h1>What is Maitria?</h1>
        <p>Short answer: we&rsquo;re not sure yet. It&rsquo;s our side project, our online
        quiet place where we remember why we&rsquo;re here. It&rsquo;s a shrine to geek joy
        and mindful programming. And maybe it will become a resource for other
        geeks who long for joy in their work.</p>
        <p>We are a work in progress. As of today (6 Jan 2013) we are hoping to
        add some resources, maybe a blog or email list, and some of our existing
        swag (you'll have to wait to find out).</p>
