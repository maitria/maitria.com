        <h1>From Clients &amp; Colleagues</h1>
        <p>"I was part of a failing team. Within one month of having Alex as a dedicated coach, we were not only working together, but writing beautiful and well tested code. She left a permanent impact and we're still practicing and swearing by her principles today." &mdash; D.C., Developer on a Javascript project
        <p>"...because of teaming with you over the past couple of months, I'm
        not only a better agilist, but an overall better developer as well." &mdash;
        client C# Developer</p>
        <p>"Your agile coaching has made tremendous impacts on the team." &mdash; client manager</p>
        <p>"I write my best code when I'm pairing with you." &mdash; K.M., Developer-Coach on C# project </p>
        <p>"I am grateful that angela would "tell it like it is" to me (and others), as I so much valued her observations and opinions -- and she is wicked smart. At the same time, if I disagreed with her on something, she would hear me out and would change her mind when (if?) I made sense :-)" &mdash; Jon Kern, Co-author of the Agile Manifesto</p>

        <h1>This is why they pay me the big bucks</h1>
        <p>Here's some of the special stuff I bring to a team:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I am caring, and know how to listen.</li>
          <li>I cut right to a clear statement of a problem or goal.</li>
          <li>I ask interesting (hard) questions &mdash; often the questions
          nobody else will bring up.</li>
          <li>I challenge a pair to write the best code they can.</li>
          <li>I break things into small steps for fast feedback.</li>
          <li>I am kind <em>and</em> honest; I do not mislead or sugar-coat.</li>
          <li>I'm a constant learner, and I encourage teams to learn.</li>
          <li>I don't much play up my strengths or try to hide my
          weaknesses. What you see is what you get.</li>
          <li>When facilitating retrospectives, I encourage
          real collaboration.</li>
        </ul>

         <h1>Programming Languages &amp; Tools</h1>
         <p>I've coded or paired in lots of languages over the past few years. Many of these were for fun. Many were for production.</p>
         <p>I don't claim expertise in all of these! And I don't every want to be the strongest, technically, on the team. I help technically strong nerds work better. I've successfully paired in each of the following techs, and helped teams learn technical practices and mindsets that made their codebase and their team a happier place to be.</p>
         <p>Recent languages and tools include:</p>
          <ul class="techstack">
            <li>Android</li>
            <li>C#</li> <li>Clojure</li>
            <li>Cucumber</li>
            <li>Entity</li>
            <li>Git</li>
            <li>Groovy</li>
            <li>J</li>
            <li>Java</li>
            <li>Javascript</li>
            <li>Jenkins</li>
            <li>Jira</li>
            <li>jUnit</li>
            <li>Kiwi</li>
            <li>nUnit</li>
            <li>Objective C</li>

            <li>Ruby</li>
            <li>Scheme</li>
            <li>Stash</li>
