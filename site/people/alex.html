      <h2>Less fear, more joy.<br/>
      It works.</h2>
      <p>If you have a team in your life that isn't communicating or collaborating as well as you know they could be, give me six weeks. With compassion and empathy, I'll pair with them, facilitate mind-opening meetings, teach practical communication skills, and be a catalyst for team growth. Less fear, more joy. It works.</p>

        <h1>From Clients &amp; Colleagues</h1>
        <p></p>
        <p>"I was part of a failing team. Within one month of having Alex as a dedicated coach, we were not only working together, but writing beautiful and well tested code. She left a permanent impact and we're still practicing and swearing by her principles today." &mdash; D.C.</p>
        <p>"Alex helped shift our development process into over-drive.  Through careful observations and small calculated changes, she helped us become a clean code power house.  She's as equally versed in agile software practices as she is at team communication." &mdash; C.P.</p>
        <p>"...because of teaming with you over the past couple of months, I'm not only a better agilist, but an overall better developer as well." &mdash; T.S.</p>
        <p>"I write my best code when I'm pairing with you." &mdash; K.M.</p>
        <p>"I am grateful that Alex would 'tell it like it is' to me (and others), as I so much valued her observations and opinions -- and she is wicked smart. At the same time, if I disagreed with her on something, she would hear me out and would change her mind when (if?) I made sense :-)" &mdash; Jon Kern (co-author of the Agile Manifesto)</p>
