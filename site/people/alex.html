      <h2>Less fear, more joy.<br/>
      It works.</h2>
      <p>If you have a team in your life that isn't communicating or collaborating as well as you know they could be, give me six weeks. I'll pair with them, facilitate mind-opening meetings, teach practical communication skills, and be a catalyst for technical growth. Less fear, more joy. It works.</p>

        <h1>From Clients &amp; Colleagues</h1>
        <p>"I was part of a failing team. Within one month of having Alex as a dedicated coach, we were not only working together, but writing beautiful and well tested code. She left a permanent impact and we're still practicing and swearing by her principles today." &mdash; D.C. (Javascript)</p>
        <p>"Alex helped shift our development process into over-drive.  Through careful observations and small calculated changes, she helped us become a clean code power house.  She's as equally versed in agile software practices as she is at team communication." &mdash; C.P. (Tech lead)</p>
        <p>"...because of teaming with you over the past couple of months, I'm not only a better agilist, but an overall better developer as well." &mdash; T.S. (C#)</p>
        <p>"Your agile coaching has made tremendous impacts on the team." &mdash; D.S.</p>
        <p>"I write my best code when I'm pairing with you." &mdash; K.M.</p>
        <p>"I am grateful that Alex would 'tell it like it is' to me (and others), as I so much valued her observations and opinions -- and she is wicked smart. At the same time, if I disagreed with her on something, she would hear me out and would change her mind when (if?) I made sense :-)" &mdash; Jon Kern (co-author of the Agile Manifesto)</p>

      <h1>Programming Languages &amp; Tools</h1>
      <p>I help technically strong nerds work better. I've successfully paired in each of the following techs, and helped teams learn technical practices &amp; attitudes that made their codebase and their team a happier place to be.</p>
