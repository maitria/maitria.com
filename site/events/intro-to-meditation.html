        <h4>Alex Harms</h4>
        <p>Alex began studying mindfulness techniques since 1985, and began teaching in 2007. She has studied formal logic, zen buddhism, humanistic psychology, and sat with teachers ranging from Marshal Rosenberg and Conal Elliott to Neale Donald Walsh and Kim Krishbaum.

      <p>The folks I worked with supported diversity, understand that there are benefits to the project and to the team. And yet I looked around and found myself around white men. How does this keep happening? It's the 21st Century. We know we want a new way of working, but how do we get there? We get there by taking action to change what we're doing, so we can get different results.</p>
      <p>The course draws on mindfulness traditions including Zen Buddhism, Humanistic Psychology, Focusing, Yoga, Tibetan Buddhism, Nonviolent Communication, and, you know, <em>modern science</em>.</p>
      <p>As a small group (up to 9, plus the instructor), we'll begin with a foundation of traditional zen meditation. From there we'll explore additional techniques &amp; lessons focused on building specific mindfulness skills.</p>
