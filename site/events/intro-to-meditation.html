        <p>We'd like to invite you to join our six-week online class. Weekly group instruction and meditation sessions will happen via Hangouts, and throughout the course you'll have an online community for questions and thoughts that come to you between sessions. Together with a small group of other technical folks, you'll learn meditation basics and intermediate techniques, and begin to form habits that can stick with you.</p>

        <p>Ok, here's the nitty gritty. Once you're signed up, you'll receive an email with information about the online community. Here, you'll learn about each week's topic, find links to resources like audio files and readings, and you'll be able to log your sitting practice and post questions or thoughts that come up.</p>
        <p>This first time, we're offering the classes at half the price we expect to ask later &mdash; $180 instead of $360. (We'll also have scholarship slots in each class.)</p> 
        <p>The first session will be introductory instruction. In the next five weekly sessions, we'll typically start with a welcome and Q&amp;A, followed by a 20 minute session. Afterwards, a short talk on a topic related to mindfulness, and then we'll learn a supplemental technique for the following week's practice. Folks may enjoy staying after class for some social time.</p>
        <p>Between classes, we'll talk to one another in the online community. There you can post questions or discuss your experiences throughout the week. The instructors will be active in the community as well, answering questions and making fart jokes.</p>
        <p>Lastly, you'll also have the opportunity to sign up for a one-on-one sessions, in case there are questions you'd like to ask privately.</p>
        <p>When I (Alex) wanted to start a meditation practice, it was a real struggle. I finally realized I needed to people to sit with, or it wouldn't happen. That's how I ended up at the Zendo, and it was a huge help. Our intent is to provide support for you, as you start (or continue) your practice.</p>
